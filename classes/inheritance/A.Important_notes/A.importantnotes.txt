notes::

Analogy::
1. basics --> child inherits properties of the parents + extra

2. In my case , constructor should preceeded by "public" keyword

3. In my case , linking of .cpp to .h is not happening  , therfore i never used .cpp files for the defination of the methods of the class

4. i also have to write the public keyword 


understand linking process:: (universal concept )

1. linker have some trouble refer to error file 



BASE CLASS ACCESS SPECIFIER

1. there are three   (inside derived classes in the )
             1.1  public 
             1.2  protected
             1.3  private


2. members that are private to the base can never be accessible from the derived classes
