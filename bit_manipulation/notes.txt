important points 

1. Byte is the smallest addressable unit in modern computers.
2. bit manipulation  ---- every object in c++ are groups of bit  and changing\modifying each bit is known as bit manipulation.

3. bit flag 
        3.1  flag is a value that signals    for a condition , of its existance.
        3.2 bit flag uses 0 or 1 as a signal



4.  bit indexing 
               4.1   from right to left ( starts from 0 to inf)


BITWISE operator

5. use bitwise operator with unsigned integer  ----(safer)


ther are 6  
         5.1   shifting 
                    5.1.1 left shifting <<
                    5.1.2  right shifting >>
         5.2    
               5.2.1 bitwise or (|)   
               5.2.2
                      bitwise and (&)
         
         5.3   xor(^)
         5.4   not (~)



6.   how to do rotation   ==========>>      right + left shift  to the bit object   refer to the code
